## DNCP contract code

For each contract, the DNCP generates a contract code that differs from the id of the contractId it self, and this information is relevant because it helps users to link a contract in Hacienda with a contract in DNCP. Users are very used to working with this information in Paraguay, and as such it is needed for the Paraguayan users of the data.

##### Example:
```javascript
"contracts": [
    {
        "id": "246807-11-setiembre-srl-4",
        "awardID": "246807-adqusicion-guantes-otros-insumos-medicos",
        "dncpContractCode": "CD-13003-13-70684",
        ...
    }
]
```
